# SSH Configuration Template
# Copy your actual SSH keys and config here

# Example SSH config structure:
# Host example
#     HostName example.com
#     User username
#     IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
#     Port 22

# After copying your files here, they will be encrypted by git-crypt
# Your actual keys (id_rsa, id_ed25519, etc.) should be placed in this directory
