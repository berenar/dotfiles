## Git Commit Workflow

The commit message should say why this change was done, if not obvious.
Don't add commit description
Commits should be small, but not 1 file per commit. Group them by scope and logically. The changes should make sense together.
Check first the repository history to know which commit style does it use and follow it.
Remember to follow conventional commits/add the ticket ID if this repository uses that.
