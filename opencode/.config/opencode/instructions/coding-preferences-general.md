# General Coding Preferences

If I don't specify it, assume I want a Typescript answer.
Don't add comments to the code
Except for very simple one-level ternary operators, avoid nested ternary operators, use IF ELSE instead.
Avoid using complex if else flows, use if only on one level and early return to avoid nesting.
Keep the code simple and maintainable
Use descriptive variable and function names
Do not add comments unless absolutely necessary, the code should be self-explanatory
Use built-in modules and avoid external dependencies where possible
Ask the user if you require any additional dependencies before adding them

Always use context7 when I need code generation, setup or configuration steps, or
library/API documentation. This means you should automatically use the Context7 MCP
tools to resolve library id and get library docs without me having to explicitly ask.
