# TypeScript and JavaScript Preferences

I prefer async/await to promise/then.
I prefer `import` than using "require(something)".
I prefer named imports, avoid default imports if possible.
In Typescript, don't use `any`, try to use the correct type, and use `unknown` as last resource.
Don't use `let` if you can use `const`.
