Your task is to fetch the latest information from [GitHub Copilot Model Multipliers](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/concepts/billing/copilot-requests#model-multipliers).

- Summarize all listed Copilot models and their pricing multipliers for paid plans in a markdown table.
- The table must have two columns: **Model** and **Multiplier** (for paid plans).
- Sort the table by multiplier value, ascending (0 is lowest, 10 is highest).
- Format the table for readability.
- Include every model shown on the page.
- Output only the markdown tableâ€”no extra text or explanation.
