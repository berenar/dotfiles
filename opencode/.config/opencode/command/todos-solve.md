1. Check which TODO, FIX, FIXME, etc. comments exist in the codebase
2. Ignore all the ones that were already there before the current feature branch
3. List them sorted by easiest to solve first
4. Ask me which ones should you solve
5. Solve the ones I tell you one by one
6. Commit using /commmit
7. Repeat steps 3 to 6 until finished
