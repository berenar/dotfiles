# Security Analysis Report

**Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Repository:** berenar/dotfiles  
**Analyzed by:** GitHub Copilot Agent

## Executive Summary

A comprehensive security scan was performed on the dotfiles repository to check for exposed secrets, tokens, API keys, and other sensitive information. The analysis included:

- Current file content scanning
- Git history analysis  
- Pattern matching for common secret formats
- Automated secret detection using gitleaks

## Findings

### âœ… No Secrets Found

**Good news!** No actual secrets, tokens, or API keys were found exposed in this repository.

### What Was Checked

1. **Current Files**: All configuration files were scanned for:
   - API keys and tokens
   - Passwords and secrets
   - GitHub Personal Access Tokens
   - AWS credentials
   - Private keys
   - OAuth tokens
   
2. **Git History**: The entire commit history was analyzed for:
   - Previously committed but later removed secrets
   - Patterns matching common secret formats
   
3. **Environment Files**: Verified that:
   - `.env` files are properly ignored via `.gitignore`
   - Only `.env.dist` template files are committed (with no actual values)

## Security Posture

### âœ… Good Practices Identified

1. **Environment Variable Protection**
   - The repository uses environment variable references (`{env:GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN}`) instead of hardcoded values
   - `.env` files are properly excluded via `.gitignore`
   - A `.env.dist` template file is provided without actual secrets

2. **Plugin Protection**
   - An `env-protection.ts` plugin prevents AI agents from writing to `.env` files
   - This adds an extra layer of protection against accidental secret exposure

3. **GitIgnore Configuration**
   - `.env` files are properly ignored: `**/.env`
   - `.DS_Store` files are ignored

### ðŸ“‹ Current Configuration Files

The following files reference secrets via environment variables (safe):
- `opencode/.config/opencode/opencode.json` - References `GITHUB_PERSONAL_ACCESS_TOKEN` and `CONTEXT7_API_KEY`
- `opencode/.config/opencode/.env.dist` - Template file with empty values

## Recommendations

### Already Implemented âœ…
- âœ… Use environment variables for secrets
- âœ… Ignore `.env` files in git
- âœ… Provide `.env.dist` templates
- âœ… Implement plugins to prevent AI from modifying sensitive files

### Additional Recommendations

1. **Secret Scanning in CI/CD** (Optional)
   - Consider adding gitleaks as a pre-commit hook
   - Add GitHub's secret scanning alerts (if available for private repos)

2. **Documentation**
   - Document in README how to set up environment variables
   - Include a security section in documentation

3. **Regular Audits**
   - Periodically scan for secrets, especially after major changes
   - Review access tokens and rotate them regularly

## Conclusion

The repository follows security best practices for handling secrets. No sensitive information is exposed in the current state or historical commits. The use of environment variables and proper `.gitignore` configuration provides good protection against accidental secret exposure.

## Tools Used

- **gitleaks v8.18.2** - Secret detection in git repositories
- **grep pattern matching** - Custom regex patterns for common secret formats
- **git log analysis** - Historical commit inspection
